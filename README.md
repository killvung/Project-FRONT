# Kiu-Front
Front is my ongoing personal project to trackdown my fitness data from variety of data sources

## Motivation:
I love walking, it has became my daily activities. I used an app "MapMyWalk" by Under Armour to trackdown statistics like total miles, paces or routes. Later on I start running as well thus used their "MapMyRun" for the same purpose. 

## V1
- Diagram with components
- Python Backend (front-api)
  - Flask boilerplate
  - Mongo Atlas
- Apollo GraphQL Server (apollo-server)
- Vue front with Nuxt (nuxt-front)
## Retrospect
- Too many hops
- UI will be complicated implemented in the future

## V2
- Diagram with components
- "serverless" Apollo GraphQL server
  - Hack
- Vue Application powered by CoreUI template
  - Life easier by modification
